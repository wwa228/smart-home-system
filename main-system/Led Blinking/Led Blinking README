This lab aims to help us understand how microcontrollers interact with the real world: Digital Input and Output. We studied how to toggle the microprocessor for the two LEDâ€™s: Red and Green. 
RED LIGHT TOGGLING : This shows how the red light blinks on when we press the push button for it. The libraries included are #include <msp430.h> The pin number for Red LED (P1.0):
Toggles on/off each time Button 1 (P4.1) is pressed. The button (P1.0) is the input and button 1 (P4.1) is the output
GREEN LIGHT TOGGLING: This shows how the green light blinks on when we press the push button for it. The libraries included are #include <msp430.h> The pin number for Green LED (P6.6):
Toggles on/off each time Button 1 (P2.3) is pressed. The button (P6.6) is the input and button 1 (P2.3) is the output.
To ensure the proper running of the code,
The appropriate pins (P1.0 for the red LED, P6.6 for the green LED, P4.1 for Button 1, and P2.3 for Button 2) are wired correctly.
GPIO_DRIVER.c: The source file writes provides the code for interacting with and controlling the GPIO pins of the MSP430. The libraries involved are #include <msp430.h>
GPIO_DRIVER.h: The header file is used for declaring the functions without properly defining the function. The functions gpioInitIn() and gpioInitOut() shows how to configure the intialization of the pins.
GPIO_DRIVER_MAIN.c: This file is used for calling the function declared and defined in the header and source file.The libraries involved are #include <msp430.h>
