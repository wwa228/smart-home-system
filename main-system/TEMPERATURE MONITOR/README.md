This code involves measuring the internal and external temperature of a microprocessor circuit using an MSP430 microcontroller.
The code is designed to interface with the internal temperature sensor and an external temperature sensor, processing the data to display temperature readings in degrees Celsius.
Additionally, it helps monitor voltage drop and current flow through the circuit using a digital multimeter, which is essential for circuit analysis.
